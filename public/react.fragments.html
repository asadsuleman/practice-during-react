<!-- What is a react fragment?
A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. 
Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. -->



<!-- if u have multiple child elemnts so u have to rape them in a parent element
other vise react will throw error so react.fragment solve the extra elemnt issue 
we rape our chiled elements in      <react.fragment>  </react.fragment>    --
